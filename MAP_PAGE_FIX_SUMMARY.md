# Map Page Fix Summary

## Problem
The MapPage was failing to load due to missing dependencies and incompatible package versions.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Custom Draw Control
**File:** `src/components/LeafletDrawControl.jsx`
- Custom wrapper around leaflet-draw to avoid react-leaflet-draw compatibility issues
- Works with React 18 and react-leaflet v4.2.1
- Supports rectangle, polygon, and circle drawing

### 2. Updated MapPage
**File:** `src/pages/MapPage.jsx`
- Replaced `react-leaflet-draw` import with custom `LeafletDrawControl`
- Removed non-existent `AlertsPanel` and `AnalyticsPanel` imports
- Removed unused `FeatureGroup` import
- Map should now load properly once dependencies are installed

### 3. Created Installation Files
- **`install-map-deps.bat`** - Double-click to install dependencies
- **`INSTALL_MAP_DEPENDENCIES.md`** - Manual installation instructions

## To Fix the Error

### Option 1: Run the Batch File (Easiest)
1. Navigate to `agri-riskiq-frontend` folder
2. Double-click `install-map-deps.bat`
3. Wait for installation to complete

### Option 2: Manual Installation
Open terminal in `agri-riskiq-frontend` folder and run:

```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet@4.2.1 leaflet-draw react-draggable --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Option 3: If PowerShell Blocks npm
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
3. Then run the npm install command

## What the Map Page Will Have

Once dependencies are installed, the map will feature:

âœ… **Interactive Leaflet Map** with satellite imagery
âœ… **4 Overlay Modes:**
   - ðŸ›° Satellite (default)
   - ðŸŒ¿ NDVI (vegetation health)
   - â˜” Rainfall data
   - ðŸ”¥ Risk heatmap

âœ… **Drawing Tools** (top-right corner):
   - Rectangle
   - Polygon
   - Circle
   - Delete tool

âœ… **AI Risk Scoring:**
   - Draw a zone to get instant AI risk score
   - Color-coded: Green (low), Orange (moderate), Red (high)

âœ… **Interactive Features:**
   - Click county markers for details
   - Draggable legend
   - Opacity slider for overlays
   - Popup information

âœ… **Summary Panel:**
   - Lists all drawn zones
   - Shows risk scores
   - Tracks zone types

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/pages/MapPage.jsx` - Fixed imports and removed non-existent components
2. âœ… `src/components/LeafletDrawControl.jsx` - Created custom draw control
3. âœ… `agri-riskiq-frontend/install-map-deps.bat` - Installation script
4. âœ… `INSTALL_MAP_DEPENDENCIES.md` - Installation guide

## Next Steps

1. **Install dependencies** using one of the methods above
2. **Restart dev server** if it's running
3. **Navigate to Map page** in the application
4. **Test features:**
   - Switch between overlays
   - Draw zones on the map
   - Check AI risk scores
   - Drag the legend around

## Troubleshooting

### If map still doesn't load:
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all dependencies installed successfully
- Restart the development server

### If drawing tools don't appear:
- Check that leaflet-draw CSS is loading
- Verify LeafletDrawControl component is imported correctly

### If you see "Module not found" errors:
- Re-run the npm install command
- Check that you're in the correct directory (`agri-riskiq-frontend`)
- Try deleting `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then reinstall

## Package Versions Used

- `leaflet`: latest
- `react-leaflet`: 4.2.1 (compatible with React 18)
- `leaflet-draw`: latest
- `react-draggable`: latest

Note: Using `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to handle peer dependency conflicts between React 18 and some packages.
